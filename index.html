            <h3 id="who">WHO</h3>
            <p class="frankie-text">Frankie is a three year old minature pinscher that we adopted from the RISPCA in Rumford, RI back in November of 2014.  He goes by many names including, but not limited to; Frankie, Frankenstein, Goofy, Frankster, and Stein.  Frankie does like to let people know that he was named after the godfather of house music, Frankie Knuckles!</p>

            <h3 id="what">WHAT</h3>
            <p class="frankie-text">What were we thinking? Great question! HA!  In all seriousness, Frankie is the best, he may frustrate us at times, and he may occasionally find it necessary to destroy our things, but you take the good with the bad, and luckily, there is more good than bad!  As you can see in this picture, Frankie LOVES to be the security guard for our whole neighborhood.  If he don't know you, you better check in before you get into some major trouble!</p>

            <h3 id="when">WHEN</h3>
            <p class="frankie-text">When we saw him we knew right away that he would be the perfect addition to our family.  As an interesting side note, he did attempt to bite me on his first ride home from the shelter, and many people would have turned that car around and brought him back, but not us!  He stole our hearts the second we met him and no matter what he does (within reason) he'll be with us until the end!  Here's to you Frankenstein!</p>
